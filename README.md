# mips-examples

Lots of small MIPS Assembly programs I made during college.
They're classified by difficulty level. The bigger the prefix, the bigger the despair.

I hope they help someone out there.

# List of examples

* 001-sum: Sums two variables into a third
* 002-sum2: Sums two equations
* 003-division: Manual implementation of the division algorithm.
* 004-is_prime: Tells if a number is prime.
* 004-matrix-*: Does operations on matrixes
* 005-gemini-prime: Find out the nth gemini prime number.
* 005-gemini-primes-on-file: Writes some gemini prime numbers on a file.
* 005-is_prime_optimized: Tells if a number is prime with some speed hacks for
  larger numbers. Don't worry if they seem bizarre, they weren't made by a sane
  person.
* 006-biggest-gemini: Finds out the biggest 32-bit gemini number.
